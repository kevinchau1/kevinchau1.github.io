### CPSC 120

- Lab 3

  Lab 3 Part 1 was one of my favorites as well. Although this was a straightforward program to write and had only a simple function: to ask the user for ingredients for a sandwich, this was very interesting as it asked for the user's input instead of manually inputting it into the code. This was my first-hand experience writing code requiring user input, especially user input from the terminal. I liked this lab because it had user input and was my first experience with it. I learned how to code it so you can ask for the user input in the terminal and then cin that answer and spit it out with cout.

- Lab 8

  Lab 8, part 3, was also one of my favorites. This lab created an animation from not colors but from the texts, called ANSI and ASCII animation. When I was a kid, I used to create pictures out of readers such that they made a star or a happy face; however, animating it was out of my grasp. However, seeing texts become animated pictures now blows my mind and also forms from code, which is a shocker. Also, using different texts such as @ or $ to create texture in the pictures, just like the lab, is impressive as well as people can get creative on what they want to make a picture. I liked the lab because it had the animation of text aspect. I learned from this lab how to use ifstreams and ofstreams for files.

- Lab 12

  Lab 12 was one of my favorites, especially part 1, because it explores the creation of animated images or, in other words, GIFs. Creating GIFs from code was surprising because I thought animation programs could only make GIFs such as adobe animate. It wasn't limited to colors being animated in a wave; you could animate anything to your desire by coding it. I liked this lab because the animation of colors fascinates me, and the fact that you can animate a whole video with this is surprising. I learned from this lab the magick library and how to use it properly to create images from RGB colors.
