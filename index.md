### CPSC 120

- Lab 3

  Lab 3 Part 1 was one of my favorites as well. Although this was a very simple program to write and it had only simple functions which is ask the user for ingredients for a sandwhich, I thought this was very interesting as it asked for the users input instead of manually inputting it into the code. This was my first hand experience with writing code that required user input and especially user input from the terminal.

  - Lab 8

  Lab 8 part 3 was also one of my favorites. This lab consisted of created an animation from not colors but from the texts itself, called ANSI and ASCII animation. When I was a kid I used to create pictures out of texts such that it made a star or a happy face, however animating it was out of my grasp. However seeing texts become animated pictures now blows my mind and also it was created from code which is a shocker.

  - Lab 12

  Lab 12 was one of my favorites especially part 1 because it explores the creation of animated images or in other words GIFs. Creating GIFs from code was suprising to me because I thought GIFs could only be made from animation programs such as adobe animate. What was more interesting to me was that it wasn't limited to just colors being animated in a wave, you could pretty much animate anything to your desire by coding it.
